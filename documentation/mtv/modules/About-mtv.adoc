== Custom resources

{mtv-short} creates the following custom resources (CRs).

Provider::
* Created when you add a source or target provider
* Stores provider attributes in order to connect to and interact with the providers
Plan::
* Created when you create a migration plan
* Contains a list of VMs that are migrated together with the same migration parameters
* Selects VMs to fit the available migration resources until all VMs are migrated
Mapping::
* Created when you map source and target networks or source and target storage
Migration::
* Created when you run a migration plan
* Aggregates the migration progress
+  
If a virtual machine fails to migrate, you can run a new migration with the same migration plan. Only the virtual machines that have not migrated will be migrated.

== Services

{mtv-short} creates the following services.

Provider Inventory::
* Connects to the source and target providers
* Maintains a local inventory for mappings and plans
* Separate provider inventory pods for each provider enable scalability
Validation::
* Validates the suitability of a VM for migration to {virt} by applying rules
* Triggered by the Provider Inventory service whenever a VM configuration change is detected
* Stores the VM validation statusvdd
User Interface::
* Enables you to manipulate the {mtv-short} CRs
* Indicates the state of the CRs
* Displays the progress of a migration
Controller::
* Implements the logic to reconcile the CRs with the state defined by the user
+  
For example, when you create a Plan, the controllers validate it and add a status label. If a Plan fails validation, its status is `Not ready` and the Plan cannot be used to perform a migration.

* Aggregate the status of related CRs to provide a holistic and consistent view of the state of a migration
